# Chat Mail Agent

> **Early Development** – This project is under active development. Features and structure are subject to change. It is only the backend we are also parallel building the UI

## What is Gmail Smart Agent?

**Gmail Smart Agent** is an intelligent assistant designed to interact with your Gmail account just like a human assistant would. Think of it as "chatting with your inbox" — you tell it what you want, and it understands, processes, and acts accordingly.

From reading unread emails to drafting replies, categorizing messages, setting reminders, unsubscribing from spam, or summarizing long threads — this agent aims to be your smart companion for email management.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Read & Summarize Emails**  
  Quickly get the gist of new or important emails.

- **Draft and Send Replies**  
  Use natural language prompts to write professional responses.

- **Label and Categorize**  
  Automatically organize emails using custom rules or intent.

- **Unsubscribe & Clean Inbox**  
  Detect and handle promotional/spam emails with a single command.

- **Search Conversations**  
  Ask natural-language questions like: *"Show me emails from Alice last month."*

- **Reminders & Follow-ups** *(Future Scope)*  
  Set smart reminders for follow-ups or flag important actions.

## 💬 How It Works

The agent is powered by a combination of:

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**  
  To interpret your commands and queries.

- **Gmail API**  
  For secure and seamless access to your inbox.

- **Agentic Architecture** *(like LangChain / ReAct)*  
  To support multi-step reasoning and action execution.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (FastAPI or Streamlit interface)
- Gmail API & OAuth 2.0
- LangChain / LLM Backend (OpenAI / Claude / Local models)
- Vector DB (optional) for email memory and long-term understanding

## 🚧 Current Status

>  *This is an early prototype. It's still not able to do any meaningful iteractoin yet*  
Basic actions such as reading emails and parsing queries are being tested. Advanced interaction flows and UI/UX are still in progress. 

## Goals

- Make email management conversational, intuitive, and AI-powered.
- Help reduce inbox anxiety and manual email triage.
- Offer developers a customizable agent framework for their own workflows.
